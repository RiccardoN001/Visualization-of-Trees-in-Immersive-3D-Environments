# Design and Development of an Algorithm for the Visualization of Trees in Immersive 3D Environments

This repository contains the assets and code related to my bachelor thesis project, _"Design and Development of an Algorithm for the Visualization of Trees in Immersive 3D Environments"_. The goal of this project is to design and implement an algorithm that generates and visualizes tree structures within immersive 3D environments using Java and Blender. The repository is organized into several sections, including the thesis document, Java source code, and visualization files.

## Overview

This project explores how tree data structures can be visualized in a 3D environment using immersive technologies. The algorithm focuses on optimizing the visualization for performance and clarity, and the implementation supports interaction with tree data in real-time. Trees are generated randomly to test the performance and flexibility of the algorithm.

## Repository Structure

- **Thesis**: A PDF version of the thesis document, detailing the theoretical background, algorithm design, and development process.
- **Java Code**: The core of the algorithm that implements tree structure generation and manipulation, written in Java.
- **Tests**: A set of tests that generate random tree structures to evaluate the algorithm's functionality and performance.
- **Blender File**: The python script to convert the coordinates generated from the algoritm into the tree actual visualization.


## Dependencies

### Java

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher

### Blender

- Blender version 3.0 or higher
